                <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
                <li>On the project I have first worked on I was able to convince the team, that 
                we should rewrite the whole front-end application which was based on me 
                writing a PoC application including a nodeJS server and a single SQL query 
                with the front-end. Later the BE side got modified as well as my PoC became 
                the base of the new FE application.

                <h3>2018 - 2019 | Junior Software Engineer</h3>
                @Capgemini - Angular, RXJS, git
            </span>
            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>Capgemini is an outsourcing company, so it is no surprise I have been outsourced to 
                one of the GE branches, where I was working on a fintech project, which was built 
                to help the finance department on an enterprise level. This application previously 
                was written in VBA and the purpose was to create rules, which by the transactions 
                and ledger items could be paired up together.
            </p>
            <h4>Responsibilities</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Create reusable components which could be tweaked by parameters.</li>
                <li> Include web components from the corporate enterprise library.</li>
                <li>Create parameter structure for the components, so they would fit all use 
                    cases.</li>
                <li>Collaborate with the finance department discovering their requirements and 
                    needs for certain features.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Accomplishments</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Built the first generic-like PoC component, which took a JSON configuration 
                    and rendered a table and a form with custom validations. Based on this 
                    component we edited the current UI codes the same way.</li>
                <li>Roughly 6-8 months I was a solo FE Developer on the project.</li>
                <li>Documented the whole FE application on my last weekend on the project.</li>    
            </ul>

            <h4>Summary</h4>
            <p>As being my first year in the profession, I would mention it, however it is not 
                necessarily relevant to my current tech stack. However, at this company I 
                participated in one project, which I fixed a few very minor bugs, manual tested and 
                wrote the user manual for the application. I was the one keeping touch with the 
                customer regarding the handover of the user manual.</p>
